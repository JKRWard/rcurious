## Loading packages

The two important functions.

# For installation; i.e., first time only.
`install.packages("arbitrarypkge")`

# For using.
`library(arbitrarypkg)`

# We would like to install a package called "tidyverse". Let's try.

To open a code chunk in your **.Rmd**: **control+alt+i**

To knit to .html in the Viewer pane: save and **control+shift+k** 

## Loading packages

```{r pkgs}
# install.packages("tidyverse") # Run this to install.

library(tidyverse)

```


## Import example: url

```{}
# Store a string in an object.
url <- <character string>

# Read data using a tidyverse function.
db <- read_csv(url)

```


## Import example 
```{r import data}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JakeRuss/witch-trials/master/data/trials.csv"

witchdat <- read_csv(url)

```
