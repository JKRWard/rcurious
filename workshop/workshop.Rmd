## Difficulty setting

Charles T. Gray plays on **normal** tidyverse difficulty setting.

Gaming difficulty:

- the pew-pew sound my gun makes startles me (this workshop)
- normal
- hardcore

What about our other presenters?

## Here to learn together

We are here to learn from you, too. 

The plan is to live code in these notes, enabling us to edit these notes live using the wonderful [`xaringan::infinite_moon_reader`](http://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/) function, incorporating feedback.

## Notes for this workshop

We will all work from a personal copy of these slides. 

After some introductory waffling, and set-up, we'll download the file together.

You will be able to annotate these notes or write extra code examples for yourself.

Indeed, there is [little code](http://cantabile.rbind.io/2018/06/17/a-coding-workshop-without-code/) provided in these notes. But there are lots of functions. We will write the code together. 

## Pseudo code

So that you have the experience of getting your hands dirty with code, we'll use pseudo code.

```{}
<this is pseudo code>

install.packages("<you write code here>")


```

If I wanted to install a package called `metafor`, I would use the code

```{}
install.packages("metafor")

```

Notice that we drop the `<>`. That's not code, it's *pseudo code* to highlight where your input is.


## Survival tips

Don't be afraid to harness all tools available:

- Modern day coding practice comprises almost entirely searching "how do I do `<x>` in `<language>`".
- The [community](https://community.rstudio.com/) is your best resource; talk to each other and make friends and future collaborators.  
- Cheatsheets (**Help-Cheatsheets**)

```{r}
# This is a test chunk.
3 + 5

```

# What is R?

## What do R-users use R for?

R users are data detectives.

We're going to try to cover everything except *Model*.

<center>
![](https://github.com/hadley/r4ds/blob/master/diagrams/data-science-explore.png?raw=true)
</center>

This image is from [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), a great text to get started with. It's available online as a free ebook.

For us to learn how to be data detectives, we'll need some data.

# A fitting dataset

## A fitting dataset

To familiarise ourselves with R, we will do what R users do.

We will explore a dataset.

A fitting dataset. 

A few images to explain why a dataset about witch trials might be appropriate for a workshop hosted by an advocacy group for underrepresented genders.

## Image search for "witch" + "michelle wolf"

# Questions, questions that need answering

## What would you like to know?


*Group discussion*

What would you like to know?

*Write questions on whiteboard*

```{r echo = FALSE}
# Below, the <center> syntax is html to centre the gif within. Notice that it is the same syntax as importing a png, jpg, or pdf image. 

# Rmarkdown and chunks support latex, html, bash, python, and whatnot. Due to this flexibility, for some researchers, such as Charles, it is their preferred working document type.  

```

<center>
<img src="https://alloftheones.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/ezgif-save.gif" style="width:60%">
</center>

## How to answer these questions?

For *this* workshop:

- [language](https://www.r-project.org/): R
- [Integrated development environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment): RStudio

### Why these tools?

- R was intentionally developed to be a data analysis language (aeroplane) 
- RStudio is designed to help users use R (airport)

"The plane is pretty boring without the airport around it."

(Tip of the hat to Julia Lowndes for the aeroplane analogy.)


# Installation hell

## Installation overview

- install R (quick) 
- install RStudio (a little while)

Installation instructions [adapted](https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_london/blob/master/2016-04_Beginners_DropIn/April_DropIn.Rmd) with appreciation from a previous workshop. 

## Install R on Mac or Windows

Go to the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/)(CRAN) website.

It was first in a google search for 'cran' in June 2018.

***

### For Mac users

- Click on **Download R for (Mac) OS X** 
- Look at the top link under **Latest release**, which at time of writing is **R-3.5.0.pkg**, and download this if compatible with your current version mac OS (Mavericks 10.9 or higher). Otherwise download the version beneath it which is compatible for older mac OS versions. 

### For Windows users

- Click on **Download R for Windows** 
- Then click on the link **install R for the first time** 
- Download from the large link at the top of the page which at time of writing is **Download R 3.5.0 for Windows**. 

## Install R

- Then double click the downloaded **R-3.5.0.pkg** file and follow the prompts to install the downloaded software.

## Download & Install RStudio:

Go to the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) website.  

It was first in a google search for 'rstudio' in June 2018.

Choose **RStudio** and scroll down to the blue **Download RStudio Desktop** button. 

Click the green button to download **RStudio Desktop Open Source License** and select appropriate installer for your operating system.

Double click the installer and follow the prompts to set up RStudio. 

## Why RStudio?

Working in an RStudio [project](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects) has **many** benefits.

- Free, open source software R in an IDE
- Reproducible workflows

# Getting started in RStudio

## Create a project

- Open RStudio and create a project via **File-New Project**
- Select **New Directory** and choose **New Project**
- Name your project **rcurious**
- Save the project directory wherever suits you


## Argh, so many windows

*R-Ladies presenters gesticulate wildly at RStudio*

Let's start with a couple useful panes.

- Console
- Environment

### Cheat sheet

**Help-Cheatsheets-RStudio IDE Cheatsheet** 

# How to run code?!

## Running code in the Console

The console is where you can execute single-line R commands.

The console is located, by default, in the lower left pane. 

Try `3 + 2` and press **enter**:

```{r}
# Type 3 + 2 here. Here's hoping infinite moon reader works. 

```

## Environment

I can store the number 5 in an *object* `x`.

To assign a value we use an arrow `<-`.

```{}
x <- 5
```

What happens when you type `x` into the Console after assigning the value 5 to it?

What do you see in the Environment pane?

***

If I assign the value 5 to the *object* `x`, and call it in the console, it returns the value assigned.

```{r}
# Assign 5 to x and call x.
```

There are many complex data types in R.

## Data structures in R

Data *objects* can be made of

- numbers
- characters "this is a character string"
- logicals (TRUE/FALSE) 
- list (mixed)

Or tables of combinations of the above.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# The head() function displays the top of the table. Here I asked to see the top 2 lines of the preloaded iris dataset in R. These small preloaded datasets are very handy for trying things out.

head(iris, 2)

# Notice, also, that setting echo = FALSE in this chunk prevents the code and commments from displaying in the knitted document.
```


And much more.

***

The witch trials dataset is a table.

It is a [*tidy*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html) data structure:

- rows are *observations*
- columns are *variables* (attributes)

## Editor

We'll do this analysis in R markdown.

- run code in *chunks*
- write in text, LaTeX, html, outside of code chunks 
- make websites, presentations, books 


# Rmarkdown

## Opening an .Rmd

Open **File-New File-R Markdown** 

Follow the prompts to install the required *packages*.  

Give your document a title and press **ok**.

This will open an *Untitled2* template. 

Save your document - note, you have given your document a title, not saved it!

Press the wheel next to the **knit** icon at the top of the Editor pane and select Viewer.

Now we will *knit* our document.

## The tutorial document

A treasure trove! 

## Get these notes

Delete everything in your .Rmd file.

Look up `softloud charles gray github`

You want to navigate to: https://github.com/softloud

Click on **rcurious** in my Pinned repositories.

Click on **workshop** and then **workshop.Rmd** and then click the **Raw** button and copy and paste the text into your .Rmd file.

- **control + a** to select all 
- **control + c** to copy
- **control + v** to paste

## Knit the notes

**control + shift + k** to knit

But it is annoying having a pop out window, so let's view these notes in the Viewer pane.

We are going to modify the YAML at the top of the document so that you can see how to toggle a presentation into notes. 

Press the little document outline button in the top right corner of the Editor pane, and navigate to the top of the document.

```
output :
  # ioslides_presentation 
  html_document: 
     toc: true
     toc_float: true
```

Knit again. (This takes a while.) 

## Slides and notes

From now on, we'll refer to both the notes *and* the slides.

Your notes are made from the same code as the slides we're looking at.

**If you want information from a few slides ago, you can find it in your notes.** 

### Your turn

Navigate in the Viewer pane using the *floating table of contents* to the image of Hillary Clinton in the section called **A fitting dataset**.

Navigate back to this section in your Editor pane by using the **Document Outline** provided by the button in the top right of the Editor.

## Annotating these notes

Now you can take notes directly into the script file for these slides. 

Let's create a section at the top of the document called **Useful tips**.

We'll create a heading directly above the section called **Hi**. (Use your Document Outline to navigate there.)

It looks likes this at the top of the script file.
```
## Hi! 
```

- To create a heading use `#`. The more `###`, the smaller the heading.

***

We can add bullet points with  `-`. So,

```
- Euclid
- Beanie
```

renders in your output like this:

- Euclid
- Beanie


### Cheatsheet

You can make tables, insert images and videos, and much more! 

There are two cheatsheets on RMarkdown in **Help-Cheatsheets**. 

## Your turn

Ask around for a "what I wish I'd known" story about R or investigate a cheatsheet.

Find a tip that sounds useful to you and add it to your notes in your **Useful tips** section as a bullet point.

Knit your document and bask in the pretty!

### Knitting taking too long?

Try deleting the images. You can always download a fresh copy of the notes if you want to get them back.


# Packages

## Packages

Packages are collections of other people's code.

Often someone has already written a script that does what you want to do.

For example, we want to import the witch trials data. We will use a package that helps with data wrangling tasks like this, the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/). 

We're going to use the metapackage `tidyverse` to help us with our data analysis. 

## Functions

The most common element of packages are functions. R also comes preloaded with a *base* of functions commonly used. 

Functions run other people's code for us, so that we don't have to reinvent the wheel. 

We will use functions to intall and load the `tidyverse`.

### How to spot a function

- *functions* in R take the form `<function()>`

### Getting more information 

To learn more about a function, type `?function` into the Console, and the Help pane will display documentation. 

## Installing packages

We want to install the package `tidyverse`.

Take a look at the help documentation for the function `install.packages()`.

### For installation; i.e., first time only.
`install.packages("<name of package>")`
 
### For using.
`library(<name of package>)`

### Pseudo code

A friendly reminder that `<>` indicates pseudo code. You can navigate back to that section in your notes in your Viewer. 

## Your turn

We would like to install and use a package called "tidyverse". 

Let's try. 

## Let's load the tidyverse 

Press the little document outline button in the top right corner of the Editor pane.

Navigate to this part of your notes.

```{r Load the tidyverse package}
# This is a code chunk. 

# We can write informative comments with a hash # at the start.

# Load the tidyverse using the library() function.

library(tidyverse)

```

# Importing data

## Import the witch trials data

Since the data is stored on an online repository, we can import it via url. 

We can import this data using the `read_csv()` function from the `tidyverse`. 

**This function takes one argument, the url, which goes between the () as a "character string".**   

There are many types file types, which often need special care. 

*Presenters discuss different file types and old battle stories of importing data.*

## Your turn

The data is found here: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JakeRuss/witch-trials/master/data/trials.csv"

Try importing the data at the console with `read_csv`. What output do you see?

`read_csv` with the argument url produces a data object. An object we can assign.

Open a code chunk *here* and read the data in using `read_csv` and assign `<-` the data to an object called `witchdat`

- **control+alt+i** to open a code chunk. 
- press green **play** to run chunk.

## Take a look

What do you see in your Environment?

Click on it!


# Exploratory data analysis

## Exploratory data analysis

Let's explore the information in this table.

- summary
- wrangling and cleaning 
- visualisation

## Summary functions

Lots of objects in R `<an R object>` are friendly to the `summary(<an R object>)` function. 

### Your turn

What's is the output of `summary` for `witchdat`?

***

### An alternative to `summary`

An alternative is the `skim()` function from from the `skimr` package.

### Your turn

- install the `skimr` package
- Open a code chunk here and load the `skimr` package in your notes
- apply the `skim` function to the `witchdat` data

What is the difference between the output of `summary` and `skim`? Which do you like better and why?

## Group discussion

*Based on this new information, what questions do we add or update?*

At this point, we often wish to manipulate the data in some way. 

This is variously known as wrangling, cleaning, and scrubbing.

# Data wrangling

## The fine art of wrangling

## Change the name of a variable

This workshop is based on Steph de Silva's wonderful [analysis](http://rex-analytics.com/witch-hunting-europe-discovery-missingness/) *Witch Hunting in Europe: a discovery of missingness*.


One of the first things that Steph does is change the name of the column `gadm.adm0` to something more human-interpretable, `country`.

Steph notes, "This is a gross oversimplification of geography in the middle ages of Europe, but it describes the location of the trial in terms that will be most familiar to many modern users."

## Follow in the footsteps of greatness

Let's use the `rename()` function to change the name of the variable (column) `gadm.adm0` to `country`.

To do this, we'll learn a very useful operator, the pipe ` %>% `. 

## The pipe

Piping makes code easier to read (arguably).  

For example, we saw a snapshot of the preloaded iris data earlier.

The `head()` function takes one argument, a table: 
```{}
head(<some data table>). 
```

But we could also *pipe* `%>%` the data into the function.
```{}
<some data table> %>% head() 
```

### Your turn

Use the pipe function to present the top of the `witchdat` dataset. 

## Rename a column

We can rename a column by constructing a pipe from the table to the `rename` function
```
<my data> %>% 
  rename(<newname> = <oldname>)
```
### Your turn

Pipe `witchdat` to the `rename` function and change `gadm.adm0` to `country`. 

# Visualisation

## The structure of a ggplot

The tidy way of plotting data is with the `ggplot2` package, which comes with the `tidyverse`.

```
<some data> %>% # pipe the data to ggplot()

```

###  Your turn

What happens when you `%>%` the `witchdat` table into `ggplot()`?

## Aesthetics

We define x and y axes of the plot with aesthetics in `ggplot`.

```{}
<some data> %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = <column name>, y = <column name>))
```

### Your turn

What happens if you set x and y axes to column names in `aes`? 

## Your turn: my first ggplot

Let's see how many women were murdered as witches over time.  

We'll add a plot layer `+` to our ggplot using `geom_point` for a scatterplot. 

Set the x axis to *year* and the y axis to *deaths*.

```{}
<data> %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = <column with year>, y = <column with deaths>)) +
  geom_point() # Adds a scatterplot.
```


## Your turn

Using the data visualisation cheatsheet (**Help-Cheatsheets**) to figure out how to add a title layer to your plot. 

# Workshop

Sidenote, I'd recently seen Maelle Salmon speak about the benefits of blogging to engage with the community. 

This was the first time I tweeted about a blogpost; it is very reassuring to have people to bounce ideas off.

## Thank you for getting your R-curious on with us!

We hope you had fun.
